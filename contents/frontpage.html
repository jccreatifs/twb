          <p class="lead">Welcome to <em>The Word Bride Journal</em> !</p>

          <p>Welcome, dear brothers and sisters!</p>
          <p>I extend my heartfelt embrace to you as you embark on this spiritual journey with me. My mission is rooted in a profound belief in the Holy Bible as the unrivaled source of the Word of God, the ultimate <a href="/p/truth.html">Truth</a> that guides our lives towards the Rapture.

          <h3 class="text-center">An Exposition of the Heresies Within The End-time Message Churches</h3>

          <p>I stand unwaveringly on the <strong>firm foundation</strong> which is the Word of God as written in the Bible, considering its truth my one (which has been throughout the Ages, still is, and always will be) and only axiom. As we navigate the intricate Message of the Hour, I rely on the Word of God and His Holy Spirit as the steadfast compass that guides us. It is our shield against <a href="/p/reproofs.html">heretic beliefs</a>, guarding against the painful twisting of the End-time Message that can lead to the treacherous pitfalls like the <a href="/p/idolatry.html">idolatry within the End-time churches</a>. With the <a href="/p/bible.html">Bible as our unshakable cornerstone</a>, we seek to reproof and expose any distortions and heresies, ensuring that the purity of the Word remains unblemished and true to the End-time Message as delivered by <a href="/p/elijah.html">the seventh messenger of the Laodicean Age</a>.</p>

          <p>Here, within the digital pages of this site, I aim to inspect, explore, and expose the profound heretic ideas that lies within the End-time Message churches. Let us journey together as we delve into the depths of the Message of the Hour and uncover the misleading doctrines and unbiblical interpretations of the Spoken Word.</p>
